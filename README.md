# ZeeValinator
JavaScript class for validating input elements.

I need your clothes, your boots, your motorcycle and your HTML forms ðŸ˜Ž

## Installation
Use Bower to install ZeeValinator.

```
bower install zee-valinator --save
```

## Usage
#### Include jQuery before including the ZeeValinator file:

```html
<script src="bower_components/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js"></script>
<script src="bower_components/zee-valinator/dist/zee-valinator.min.js"></script>
```

#### Create a new ZeeValinator object:

```js
var zeeValinator = new ZeeValinator();
```

#### Create some validation rules as objects, with 'element' and 'rules' properties:

```js
var validationRules = [];

validationRules.push({
    // Providing 'connor_family_member' will also work,
    // ZeeValinator will then select the element with that name attribute
    element: $('select[name="connor_family_member"]'),
    rules: {
        // This is the 'required' rule, and the message in case the input value is empty
        required: 'Please select either John or Sarah'
    }
});

validationRules.push({
    element: 'password',
    rules: {
        // Multiple rules for the same input element are possible
        required: 'Please fill in a password, like h4st4-l4-v1st4 or something',
        /*
        Here is a rule with an option,
        which is separated from the message by a pipe charater.
        In this example, the 'password' element needs to have the same value
        as the 'password_check' element
        */
        matchWith: 'password_check|Passwords do not match!'
    }
});

validationRules.push({
    element: 'clothes',
    rules: {
        /*
        To make a rule conditional, or more advanced in any way, use a function
        In this example, clothes (including boots) are only needed when naked
        If the rule applies, return the error message string, otherwise return nothing,
        or anything that isn't a string
        Please note:
            ZeeValinator checks for a returned string,
            so '' will still be treated as an error message,
            so it could then add the error class to the input element,
            and add an error message element
        */
        required: function() {
            var hasClothes = $('input[name="has_clothes"]').prop('checked');

            if( ! hasClothes)
                return 'Please fill in which clothes you need';
        }
    }
});
```

#### Then run the validation rules!
The validate() method returns an array of objects, containing elements that have an error, and their error message.

ZeeValinator stops after the first error, per element. So if there are 3 rules for an element, and the second one fails, the third rule will not be checked, and it will move on to the next element, if there is one of course.

ZeeValinator sets the CSS class 'zee-valinator-error' on input elements that contain an error, and it creates a span element with the 'zee-valinator-error-message' CSS class for the error messages, right after the corresponding input element.

```js
// Pass validation rules to the validate() method
var result = zeeValinator.validate(validationRules);

/*
result:
[
    {
        $element: The element containing an error (jQuery object)
        message: The error message for the element
    }
]
*/

// Of course you can also provide an array directly
zeeValinator.validate([
    { /* Validation rule */ },
    { /* Validation rule */ }
]);

// Using only 1 rule object is also possible
zeeValinator.validate({ /* Validation rule */ });
```

## Available validations
This is the list of all validations that ZeeValinator has out of the box, please keep an eye on this list, because I'll be adding more (or maybe you will? see the 'Contributing' section):

* **alphanumeric**: Needs to contain only letters and numbers (case-insensitive).
* **email**: Needs to be a valid email address.
* **length**: Needs to be exactly # characters long.
    * length: '8|Value needs to be exactly 8 characters long'
* **match**: Needs to match an exact value.
    * match: 'test|Please type the word "test"'
* **matchWith**: Needs to match with the value of another input element.
    * matchWith: 'password_check|Please type the same password in both fields'
* **maxLength**: Needs to be at most # characters long.
    * length: '8|Value needs to be at most 8 characters long'
* **maxNumber**: Needs to be a number, and lower than or equal to #.
    * '8|Value cannot be higher than 8'
* **minLength**: Needs to be at least # characters long.
    * length: '8|Value needs to be at least 8 characters long'
* **minNumber**: Needs to be a number, and higher than or equal to #.
    * '8|Value cannot be lower than 8'
* **personName**: Needs to be a valid person name.
* **numeric**: Needs to be a number.
* **phone**: Needs to be a valid phone number.
* **required**: Needs to be filled in, selected or checked.

## Configuring
To change the CSS classes, and the HTML tag name for the error message element, use these methods:

```js
zeeValinator.setInputErrorClass('new-input-error-class');
zeeValinator.setErrorMessageTag('div');
zeeValinator.setErrorMessageClass('new-error-message-class');
```

ZeeValinator comes shipped with many validation options, but you can add your own, or overwrite the existing ones. The newCheck() method needs the name of the validation, and the function that does the validation, alternatively, it accepts an object with name:function pairs. The function takes a value and option and needs to return a boolean, true for passed, false for failed. The option parameter is optional, and only used for validations like 'minLength' or 'matchWith'.

```js
// Create new validation logic
zeeValinator.newCheck('isJohnConnor', function(value, option) {
    // See if the person filling in your form is John Connor
    return (value == 'John Connor');
});

// Then use it as usual
zeeValinator.validate({
    element: $('input[name="full_name"]'),
    rules: {
        isJohnConnor: 'Only Johnny Boy is allowed to fill in this form'
    }
});

// Overwrite existing logic
zeeValinator.newCheck('required', function(value, option) {
    // Apart from not being empty (required), the value has to be 'motorcycle'
    return (value == 'motorcycle');
});

// The above can also be done with 1 call, using an object as the only argument
zeeValinator.newCheck({
    isJohnConnor: function(value, option) {
        // See if the person filling in your form is John Connor
        return (value == 'John Connor');
    },
    required: function(value, option) {
        // Apart from not being empty (required), the value has to be 'motorcycle'
        return (value == 'motorcycle');
    }
});
```

## Styling
Only 2 CSS selectors are needed in your styling.  
Of course this differs if you've set some other tag or CSS class (see the 'Configuring' section).

```css
/* Input elements that contain errors */
.zee-valinator-error {
    border-color: #F00;
}

/* Elements containing error messages */
span.zee-valinator-error-message {
    color: #F00;
    font-size: 90%;
}
```
